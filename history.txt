MPU401 - MPU-401 driver for OS/2

2.1     Fixed a bug in the Event manager where it was using the wrong
        linked list to store events

        Updated the documentation to include info on more sound cards.
        Documentation is now generated with PPWIZARD, so HTML and INF
        versions are available.

2.0
        Moved the command-line parser to PARAM.CPP

        The verbose output now reports the exact version number

        Fixed install script problem when IRQ-less recording is specified.

        Changed beta expiration period to from 60-90 to 30-60 days

        If the current date is earlier than the build date, the driver
        terminates with an expiration message.

0.10
        0.09 didn't actually contain the new VMPU401.SYS.  This one does.

        Added information on installing MPU-401 support for Win-OS/2.

        Added code to conditionally compile the beta expiration check

0.09
        Updated MPUTRACE.TXT

        Fixed a trap in VMPU401.SYS when IRQ-less recording is specified.

        pulTimer, the pointer to TIMER0's counter, is now always initialized,
        not just when the user requests TIMER0 services.  If TIMER0.SYS
        doesn't exist, then pulTimer points to a fake counter.

        Added the command-line utilities RTMLIST.EXE and RTMHWNOD.EXE

        Added a couple entries for specific sound cards in the online docs.
        Also fixed that annoying indent on top of each page.

0.08
        Fixed a bug with the RM code when debugging options were disabled

        Updated the documentation to talk about NOCHECKIO and NOCHECKIRQ
        side-effects. Also fixed some discrepancies between the documentation
        and the installation.

0.07
        Created a unified INSTALL.CMD that scans your system for any current
        drivers and does a simple update if necessary, otherwise starts
        MINSTALL. Removed IBM.CMD and CRYSTAL.CMD

        Updated documentation to include all new features

        Added MPU401.INF online documentation

0.06
        Fixed bug where RTMIDI would always receive a hardware failure
        message whenever it tried to open the device

        MPU401.SYS would cause a TRAP 3 when the IRQ specified by the
        /I parameter didn't exist.

        Removed MIDI.SYS from installation because it's already included
        in Warp 4 Fixpack 7.  Updated README.TXT accordingly.

        Added traces for VDD/PDD calls.

        Added MPUTRACE.TXT to describe the operation of MPUTRACE.EXE

        Fixed a typo in INSTALL.TXT

        Added VMPU401.SYS and the /O:AUDIOVDD option to enable DOS
        sharing. Only devices allocated exclusively with RM are
        protected, and only if /O:AUDIOVDD is specified.


0.05
        Renamed MPU401.TXT to INSTALL.TXT and added README.TXT

        STREAM and EVENT classes now use the heap.

        Added support for virtual destructors.

        Added event tracing support and MPUTRACE.EXE monitoring tool.

        The driver correctly stops using timing services when playback
        stops.  Thanks to Ron Schnatzmeyer for this one.

        No more hanging notes when playback stops.  Also thanks to Ron.

        Updated help file and installation scripts to include /Ix:0
        option.

        Added the updated MIDI.SYS from the DD Pack to the installation.
        Installing the new MPU-401 driver will also update RTMIDI.

        Added CRYSTAL.CMD and IBM.CMD for quick installs of the driver
        over an existing driver.

        Added version number and description field to .SYS file.  Every time
        the driver is built, the build number is incremented.

0.04
        Fixed bug where driver failed to claim a resource that was
        available.  Thanks to Ernst Fueloep for this one.

        More minor heap manager improvements

        Added expiration code for betas. Each driver now expires about
        three months after it was built. Driver also reports whether it
        was successfully installed.

        Finally fixed the VDD<->PDD bug, so AUDIOVDD support has been
        restored.  Note that although all I/O ports are supported,
        only the first IRQ is supported.  This is a limitation of IBM's
        AUDIOVDD.SYS.

0.03
        Removed installation of AUDIOVDD.

        Fixed MIDI recording.

        Added TIMER0-based (IRQ-less) recording.

0.02
        Added heap for better memory management.

        Improved Resource Manager handling - resources are now assigned
        to each device instead of the adapter.
