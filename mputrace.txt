MPUTRACE - The Theta Band MPU-401 driver tracing facility

This application is used to debug problems with the MPU-401 device driver.
You should only use this application when instructed to do so by Theta Band
Software technicaly support.  It only works with a "debug version" of
MPU401.SYS, which is NOT the version that is normally shipped.  If you
try to use MPUTRACE with a non-debug version of MPU401.SYS, you will get
a message that reads "Error 3 while trying to open MPU-401 device driver".

This software provides a real-time display of events that occur in the MPU-401
driver.  Any time the driver does something interesting, MPUTRACE will
report it.  The list of events that MPUTRACE creates is called an event log.
This event log is used by Theta Band Software to determine what the MPU-401
driver is doing.

Instructions:

1. Install the MPU-401 device driver and reboot the computer.

2. From an "OS/2 Window" command prompt, run MPUTRACE.EXE.  It will display
text something like this:

MPUTRACE - Theta Band Software MPU-401 Driver Trace Utility
Opening \DEV\NPU4011$
Creating thread
Thread() started
Hit any key to quit. Program will then exit after the next message.

3. Now you may use the MPU-401 driver as normal.  Typically, you would do
whatever necessary to recreate the problem you are experiencing.  As you
perform these steps, MPUTRACE displays lines of text that look something
like this:

TRACE_STRATEGY_OPEN (168 0xa8)
TRACE_STRATEGY_IOCTL_CAPS (513 0x201)
TRACE_STRATEGY_IOCTL_INIT (1 0x1)
TRACE_STRATEGY_IOCTL_CTRL (0 0x0)
TRACE_DDCMD_REGISTER (691011584 0x29300000)

4. At this point, Theta Band Software will give you specific instructions.
